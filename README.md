# Neighborhood-Map

This project displays the world's 6 disney land and resorts on the map and info related to it will also be displayed
in the info window on clicking the marker pointing to the location of a particulay Disney land/resort.

In this project I have used 4 apis:-
-> Google maps api = To use the map and its funtionality.
-> Google streetview api = To display the street view image of a particular location on the info window.
-> Foursquare api = To display the contact info and address of a particular location on the info window.
-> Wikipedia api = To display the small information about a particular location on the info window.

To understand the code implementation of java script, comments have been given properly in the myscript.js file.

Custom styling is done in sheet.css file under the css directory.

To run or execute this project open index.html in any web brower.

Knockout js and JQuery has also been implemented for the bindings and script functionality.

Custom images for icons have been used and are located under the img directory.
